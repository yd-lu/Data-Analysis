# Data-Analysis Exercises in Python

This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks for various data analysis exercises I've worked on. It is designed to help readers get familiar with essential data handling, visualization, and machine learning techniques in Python.

## Structure

- `scripts/`: Contains categorized `.py` scripts demonstrating:
  - **Basic operations**: `groupby`, `agg`, `apply`, `pivot_table`, `crosstab`, etc.
  - **Plotting**: Common plot types like line plot, scatter plot, box plot, and histogram using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
  - **Machine Learning**: Training and evaluating models such as: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks combining explanation, visualization, and code for end-to-end workflows.
- `data/`: Sample datasets for testing and exploration.
